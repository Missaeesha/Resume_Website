my favourite dish is jollof rice and chicken.
i go to the farmers market, get some bell pepper, hot pepper and onions.
i also get some tomato paste and chicken at walmart.
i boil the chicken with some seasoning, salt,garlic, ginger and red pepper
after boiling, i take out the chicken stock and set aside, put the chicken in the oven to grill.
i blend some bell pepper, hot pepper and onions.
i get some vegetable oil and fry the blended peppers together with some tomato paste.
after frying till its completely dry, i add the chicken stock earlier set aside with some seasoning to taste and bring to boil
i add washed rice to the boiling mixture, cover completely with foil and cook on low heat for 20 to 30 minutes.
after cooking, i stir completely and serve with the grilled chicken.
